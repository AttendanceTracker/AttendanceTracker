			Currently, in many classrooms attendance is tracked using either a Pen-and-Paper approach or with costly electronic input devices. AttendanceTracker is a new android application with the goal of offering both students and instructors an alternative to traditional methods of classroom attendance tracking and participation. Using our app is more secure than relying on more traditional methods as instructors can allow optional settings such as time and location locks to ensure that students can not cheat the system by signing in for their classmates. Our app aims to streamline the process of taking attendance for instructors. By including a web interface instructors can easily generate scannable QR Codes and create quizzes based on course content to gauge classroom involvement and participation.
